Iris Flower Classification
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on the famous Iris dataset. The classification is done using popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in Python.

Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix
Visualizing decision boundaries of classifiers
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
